# MuONITOR

This project explores the development of a real-time particle tracking system using handheld muon detectors to identify and visualize atmospheric muons from cosmic rays. Using cosmic watch detectors with silicon photomultipliers on scintillators and Arduino for signal readout, the project ais to process and display muon tracks and counts live. This project serves as a tool to engage the general public and foster interest in physics.
